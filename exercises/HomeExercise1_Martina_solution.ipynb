 ['Oscar Holland'] \n","\n","Title:  Maurizio Cattelan’s viral banana artwork ‘Comedian’ could now be worth $1.5 million \n","\n","Text of article: \n"," CNN —\n","\n","When a banana duct-taped to a wall sold for $120,000 in 2019, social media uproar and an age-old debate about the meaning of art ensued.\n","\n","But artist Maurizio Cattelan’s viral creation, titled “Comedian,” may yet prove a sound investment: On Friday, auction house Sotheby’s announced that one of the artwork’s three “editions” is going back on sale — this time with an estimate of $1 million to $1.5 million.\n","\n","For their money, the winning bidder will receive a roll of duct tape and one banana, as well as a certificate of authenticity and official instructions for installing the work. Sotheby’s confirmed to CNN that neither the tape nor, thankfully, the banana are the originals.\n","\n","“‘Comedian’ is a conceptual artwork, and the actual physical materials are replaced with every installation,” an auction spokesperson said via email.\n","\n","Cattelan and French art gallery Perrotin made headlines around the world five years ago when they displayed “Comedian” with a six-figure asking price at the Art Basel Miami Beach fair. The original was created using a banana bought in a Miami grocery store, though the gallery said it could be replaced, as per the artist’s instructions.\n","\n","The art world was split on the work’s merits, though some critics saw it as rooted in the rich tradition of conceptual works — dating back to Marcel Duchamp’s famous mounted urinal — that question the value of art itself. Crowds soon formed, with fair attendees lining up to see the viral installation.\n","\n","Video Ad Feedback Related video: Why is art so expensive? 02:42 - Source: CNN\n","\n","Events took an unexpected turn when performance artist David Datuna grabbed the banana from the wall, before peeling and eating it in front of hundreds of stunned fair attendees. He later defended the move as an artistic performance in its own right, not an act of vandalism.\n","\n","The Miami installation was eventually removed amid public safety concerns, but all three editions were sold at the fair. Two were bought by private collectors for $120,000, while the third was purchased for a higher (but undisclosed) sum, and was later donated to The Guggenheim museum in New York.\n","\n","Sotheby’s would not reveal the identity of the seller in November’s auction, but said the work’s current owner had acquired it from the collection of one of the original buyers.\n","\n","In interviews given since the Miami installation, Cattelan has described “Comedian” as a work of commentary. Speaking to the Art Newspaper in 2021 he said it was “not a joke,” calling the viral installation “a reflection on what we value.”\n","\n","The Italian artist, who is known for satirical pieces that challenge popular culture, did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment about November’s sale.\n","\n","An installation shot of \"Comedian\" released by Sotheby's auction house ahead of the sale. courtesy Sotheby’s\n","\n","In a press release announcing the sale, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art for the Americas, David Galperin, described “Comedian” as a “defiant work of pure genius.”\n","\n","“Balancing profound critical thought and subversive wit, this is a defining work for the artist and for our generation,” Galperin said, adding: “If at its core, ‘Comedian’ questions the very notion of the value of art, then putting the work at auction… will be the ultimate realization of its essential conceptual idea — the public will finally have a say in deciding its true value.”\n","\n","While this marks the first time “Comedian” will appear at auction, the work was recently exhibited at the Leeum Museum of Art in Seoul, South Korea. It was eaten then, too: An art student from Seoul National University removed the fruit and devoured it, before taping the peel back to the wall.\n","\n","“The student told the museum he ate it because he was hungry,” a gallery spokesperson told CNN after the 2023 incident. The museum later replaced the eaten banana with a fresh one.\n","\n","Sotheby’s intends to exhibit the artwork ahead of the sale, which takes place at the auction house’s New York headquarters on November 20. “Comedian” will be put on show there on Monday before it embarks on a world tour stopping in London, Paris, Milan, Hong Kong, Dubai, Taipei, Tokyo and Los Angeles.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["👋 ⚒ Use the above article or a news article of your choice and print the number of unique words in the

Ihre Server-Farmen fressen Energie und verbrauchen große Mengen Wasser. Die Emissionen der großen Tech-Konzerne wachsen durch die milliardenschweren Entwicklungen im KI-Bereich weiter an. Gleichzeitig entwickeln Forscher:innen KI-Anwendungen, die uns beim Klimaschutz unterstützen könnten - auch in Österreich. Was überwiegt beim KI-Hype? Chancen oder Risiken?\n","\n","Kaum eine andere Technologie hat in den vergangenen Jahren einen solchen Hype erlebt wie die “Künstliche Intelligenz”. Studierende nutzen KI-Modelle für Seminararbeiten, Ärzt:innen als Unterstützung für Diagnosen und Unternehmen immer öfter als Verkaufsargument. Es gebe kaum ein Produkt, dass sich nicht durch Künstliche Intelligenz verbessern ließe. Das möchte uns die Tech-Industrie jedenfalls glauben lassen.\n","\n","Ganz vorne dabei sind Tech-Giganten wie Microsoft oder Alphabet. Der Mutterkonzern von Google integrierte sein Modell “Gemini” im März direkt in die allgemeine Suchfunktion. Bei der Microsoft-Suchmaschine Bing ist das schon längst Standard. Das Beispiel zeigt: Ob wir wollen oder nicht und ob es uns immer klar ist oder nicht, wir nutzen KI mittlerweile im Alltag.\n","\n","Viele verwenden Künstliche Intelligenz aber auch ganz bewusst, lassen zum Beispiel ChatGPT E-Mails formulieren oder Texte zusammenfassen. Aufgaben, die bislang auch gut ohne Künstliche Intelligenz erledigt wurden. Doch mit den KI-Anwendungen geht es oft schneller, einfacher, effizienter.\n","\n","Reality Check für den KI-Hype\n","\n","Der KI-Hype hat allerdings auch seine Schattenseiten. Ihrem Namen wiedersprechend, sind KI-Modelle nämlich nicht wirklich “intelligent”. Mit Hilfe der ihnen verfügbaren Daten berechnen sie lediglich die wahrscheinlichsten Antworten auf unsere Anfragen. Und lassen dabei auch Vorurteile und Ressentiments aus den Trainingsdaten weiterleben. Regelmäßig spucken sie außerdem gänzlich falsche Antworten, sogenannte “Halluzinationen”, aus, weil sie wahr und falsch nicht unterscheiden kann. Ein Problem, das viele mit der aktuellen Technologie nicht für lösbar halten.\n","\n","Für die Arbeitswelt ist schon jetzt ist abzusehen, dass viele Unternehmen KI vor allem als Chance sehen, Arbeitsplätze und damit Geld einzusparen. Eingesetzt wird es etwa schon bei der Durchsicht von Bewerbungen in Personalabteilungen. Trifft „Künstliche Intelligenz” eigenständig wichtige Entscheidungen – vielleicht weil der Mensch, der eingreifen könnte, schon eingespart ist – sind Fehler und diskriminierende Grundlagen besonders schwerwiegend. Über die Datenschutz- und Urheber-rechtlichen Probleme, die sich beim Training von ChatGPT und Co ergeben und die Überflutung des Internets mit KI-generiertem Trash-Content haben wir da noch gar nicht gesprochen.\n","\n","Die Klimakrise und die KI\n","\n","Nicht zuletzt hat die KI auch ein Klima-Problem.\n","\n","Stellt man großen KI-Modellen wie ChatGPT, Gemini oder Copilot eine Frage, wird diese nicht vom eigenen Laptop beantwortet. Stattdessen wird sie in kleine Datenpakete zerlegt und durch Glasfaserkabel quer über den Erdball zu einem Rechenzentrum von OpenAI, Google oder Microsoft geschickt.\n","\n","Das ist zwar erstmal nicht anders als bei einer Suchmaschine. Der Unterschied liegt aber in der Rechenleistung, die notwendig ist, um die gewünschte Antwort zu erstellen. Bis zu zehnmal mehr Energie als für eine Google-Suche wird dazu laut einer Untersuchung von Goldman Sachs benötigt. Das ist auch ein Problem fürs Klima. Auf jeden Fall so lange wir unseren Strom nicht komplett aus erneuerbaren Energien beziehen.\n","\n","Wie viel Energie verbraucht KI?\n","\n","Herauszufinden, wie viel Energie ein KI-Modell tatsächlich verbraucht, ist gar nicht so einfach. Die großen Tech-Firmen halten sich zum Energieverbrauch ihrer Tools bewusst sehr bedeckt. Mit der kommerziellen Nutzung kam auch mehr Geheimhaltung.\n","\n","Um zu erkennen, dass der Energiehunger der Künstlichen Intelligenz zum Problem für das Klima werden könnte, reicht allerdings ein Blick auf die Treibhausgasemissionen von Google. Eigentlich sollte das Unternehmen bis 2030 klimaneutral werden. Tatsächlich sind Googles Emissionen seit 2019 aber sogar laut eigenen Angaben um fast 50 Prozent gestiegen (PDF: Seite 8 bzw 31.). Das Unternehmen schreibt dies auch dem Wachstum seiner Rechenzentren zu und erklärt, dass es aufgrund der intensiven KI-Nutzung schwierig werden könnte, die schädlichen Ausstöße in naher Zukunft zu verringern.\n","\n","Der Wasserverbrauch der Künstlichen Intelligenz\n","\n","Warum aber verbrauchen diese Rechenzentren so viel Energie? Neben dem Betrieb der Computer selbst, lässt vor allem die Kühlung der Rechenzentren, die Stromrechnung der Betreiber in die Höhe schnellen. Darauf reagieren die Unternehmen, indem sie Rechenzentren dort aufstellen, wo sie sich möglichst kostengünstig mit Strom versorgen lassen. Zum Beispiel in sonnigen Gebieten wie Kalifornien oder Arizona, wo es billigen Solarstrom gibt. Der Solarstrom fehlt dann aber anderswo, zudem gibt es dort auch enorm hohe Temperaturen. Das verursacht wiederum einen größeren Kühlbedarf, und erhöht so auch den Wasserverbrauch der Anlagen.\n","\n","Wasserkühlsysteme, wie sie in den USA verbreitet sind, sind zwar energieeffizienter als Luftkühlung, verbrauchen aber Frischwasser. Eine Ressource, die nicht nur in der amerikanischen Wüste zusehends knapp wird. Schätzungen gehen davon aus, dass KI-Rechenzentren alleine bis 2027 halb so viel Wasser verbrauchen werden, wie ganz das gesamte Vereinigte Königreich von Großbritannien.\n","\n","Nachhaltigkeit durch Wasserkraft und Bergluft?\n","\n","Es gehe auch anders, erklärt Ivan Dukic, Gründer des KI-Startups Localmind: “Wo die Rechenzentren gebaut werden, entscheidet maßgeblich darüber, welchen Klimaeffekt sie haben. Und wenn ich das mitten in die Wüste stelle, ist es halt ein absoluter Energiewahnsinn.” Die Server für seine KI-Modelle stehen daher in einer Gegend, die mit einer Wüste so gar nichts gemein hat. Mitten in den Alpen, in der Nähe von Innsbruck.\n","\n","Dort haben die Innsbrucker Kommunalbetriebe einen alten Trinkwasserspeicher im Berg zu einem modernen Rechenzentrum umgebaut. Die Kühlung ist hier kein großes Thema. “Generell bleibt das Ganze durch die Höhe, die Luft und die schattige Lage sehr lange kühl, ohne Kühlmittel zu verwenden”, meint Ivan Dukic. Bis 20 Grad Außentemperatur kann man die Anlage nur über die Außenluft kühlen. So warm wird es dort nur in den Sommermonaten. Braucht man sie doch einmal, wird die Kühlanlage, genauso wie der Rest des Rechenzentrums, mit Strom aus regionaler Wasserkraft betrieben.\n","\n","Auch Ralph Hintemann, der am Borderstep Institut zu Digitalisierung und Nachhaltigkeit forscht, betont die Relevanz der richtigen Standortwahl. Besonders in Ballungszentren ergäben sich Vorteile, da Abwärme der Rechenzentren zum Heizen umstehender Wohngebiete genutzt werden könnte. “Was da an Strom reingeht, geht zum Teil als Wärme wieder raus. Diese Wärme können wir auch nutzbar machen.”\n","\n","Großes Hirn, großer Energieverbrauch\n","\n","Die Frage nach der Nachhaltigkeit entscheidet sich allerdings nicht allein im Rechenzentrum. Auch das verwendete KI-Modell spielt eine Rolle. Die Bandbreite dabei ist groß und reicht von Meta-Modellen wie Gemini oder ChatGPT bis hin zu einfachen Programmen mit engem Anwendungsfeld. “Das eine ist ein Riesengehirn, sowas wie ChatGPT. Und dann gibt es kleinere, spezialisierte Gehirne, die wesentlich weniger Rechenressourcen brauchen.”, fasst Dukic den Unterschied zusammen.\n","\n","Weniger Rechenressourcen, das bedeutet in diesem Kontext auch weniger Energieverbrauch. Der Grund: “Riesengehirne”, wie das von ChatGPT werden mit Unmengen an Texten trainiert. Von Shakespeare bis zur Gebrauchsanleitung deines Staubsaugers ist alles dabei. Stellt man dem Chatbot eine Frage, wird dieser ganze Info-Haufen aktiviert. Logisch, dass das mehr Energie verbraucht, als eine Künstliche Intelligenz, die mit weniger Daten trainiert wurde, um dann gezieltere Aufgaben zu übernehmen. (Die sie dann oft auch besser erledigt.)\n","\n","Laut einer US-amerikanischen Untersuchung verbrauchten sogenannte “Multi-Purpose-Modelle” 33 mal mehr Energie als “aufgabenspezifische Software”. Generell gilt also: Je spezialisierter die KI, desto geringer ihr Energieverbrauch.\n","\n","Hier offenbart sich eines der grundlegenden Probleme des aktuellen KI-Hypes. Die Modelle, die häufig für die banalsten Dinge benutzt werden, sind auch die Modelle, die die meiste Energie fressen. Während eine Menge Energie also für kleine Erleichterungen im Alltag draufgeht, tragen spezialisierte KI-Modelle an anderer Stelle sogar aktiv zum Klimaschutz bei.\n","\n","KI-Versprechen: Bessere Wetterprognosen für grüne Energie\n","\n","In der Meteorologie sei KI eigentlich nichts Neues, erklärt Irene Schicker, von der Geosphere Austria. Die Grundlage der aktuell besonders populären Formen von KI ist sogenanntes “Maschinenlernen”. Damit werden große Datensätze mit Algorithmen analysiert. Das werde in anderer Form in ihrem Feld schon lange genutzt, um Daten zu analysieren und auszuwerten. Trotzdem hätte es in den letzten Jahren nochmal einen Umbruch gegeben.\n","\n","Mit ihrem Team arbeitet Schicker an einem Forschungsprojekt mit dem knackigen Namen Atmol4REN-4Cast. Dabei nutzen sie Künstliche Intelligenz, um regionale Wetter- und Klimaprognosen zu verbessern. Das sei entscheidend für die Energiewende.\n","\n","“Erneuerbare Energien sind sehr stark davon abhängig, wie gerade die atmosphärischen Bedingungen sind.”, erklärt Schicker. Schon kleine Wetteränderungen können große Auswirkungen auf die Stromproduktion von Solar- und Windkraftanlagen haben. Um das Stromnetz stabil zu halten, braucht es daher genaue, ortsspezifische Wetterprognosen. Und das quasi in Echtzeit.\n","\n","Effizientere Windparks und Solaranlagen\n","\n","Herkömmliche Wettermodelle können das kaum leisten. Zwar lassen sich die großen, überregionalen Entwicklungen gut vorhersagen. Bei Prognosen für einen spezifischen Standort stoßen sie allerdings an ihre Grenzen. Um so nah heranzuzoomen, sind die zugrundeliegenden Berechnungen zu komplex.\n","\n","Künstliche Intelligenz soll dazu beitragen, dieses Problem zu lösen. Basierend auf den bestehenden Wettermodellen und mithilfe von Echtzeitdaten einzelner Wetterstationen, berechnet das Modell Prognosen mit großer räumlicher Auflösung. Und ist dabei schneller und energieeffizienter als die herkömmlichen Modelle.\n","\n","Auch für die Planung neuer Windparks und Solaranlagen bietet das Projekt Vorteile. Angewendet auf ein Klimamodell lassen sich mit diesem Prinzip die Wetterverhältnisse an einem Ort in fünf, zehn oder zwanzig Jahren prognostizieren. Das ist gerade für die Planung neuer Windkraftanlagen entscheidend. Wer heute einen Windpark baut, möchte davon ausgehen können, dass an seinem Standort auch in Zukunft genug Wind zur Verfügung steht.\n","\n","KI und Klima: Überwiegen die Chancen die Risiken?\n","\n","Ist Künstliche Intelligenz also ein Klimakiller oder hilft sie uns sogar, das Klima besser zu schützen? Kommt darauf an, meint der Digitalisierungsforscher Ralph Hintemann: “Das Problem ist, dass es dabei häufig um Potenziale geht”. Und die müssten erstmal verwirklicht werden. Richtig eingesetzt, könne “Künstliche Intelligenz” durchaus große Veränderungen der Treibhausausstöße bringen – das sei aber kein Selbstläufer.\n","\n","Die Unternehmen müssten das auch zum Ziel machen. Aber davon ist erst einmal wenig zu sehen. Glaubt man den Prognosen der Internationale Energieagentur, wird Künstliche Intelligenz schon 2026 für 1,5 bis 2 Prozent des weltweiten Energieverbrauchs verantwortlich sein. Zwei- bis dreimal so viel, wie ganz Österreich. Um die Emissionswaage ins Positive zu bewegen, müsste die KI also ganz schön viele “Potenziale” ausschöpfen.\n","\n","Dennoch meint Hintemann, er könne sich kaum vorstellen, “dass wir die großen Herausforderungen, die wir jetzt beim Klimaschutz haben, ohne Digitalisierung und KI hinbekommen werden.” Dazu seien große Effizienzsteigerungen nötig, zu denen KI-Anwendungen maßgeblich beitragen könnten. Allerdings seien dabei solche Anwendungen zu fördern, die wirklich ressourcensparend sind.\n","\n","Es geht in die falsche Richtung\n","\n","Der Trend geht derzeit in eine andere Richtung. “KI wird aktuell hauptsächlich dazu eingesetzt, Konsum anzukurbeln”, so Hintemann. Egal ob Amazon oder TikTok, große Techkonzerne nutzen die Technologie, um uns zum Kaufen oder zum Weiterscrollen zu bewegen.\n","\n","Gesellschaftlichen Fortschritt bringen andere Modelle. Hintemanns Fazit: “Es kann eigentlich nur mit effizienten, schlanken Lösungen funktionieren. Wir sollten KI dort einsetzen, wo sie wirklich hilft, effizienter zu werden und gleichzeitig wenig Ressourcen braucht. Dazu müssen wir nicht mit Riesenmodellen arbeiten, sondern mit schlanken, direkt auf die Anwendung spezialisierten Modellen, die auch aus anderen Gründen unkritischer sind.”\n","\n","Die Verantwortung, eine nachhaltigere Betriebsweise zu etablieren, liegt hier vor allem bei den Konzernen. Trotzdem sollten wir uns fragen, wo der Einsatz von KI wirklich sinnvoll ist. Das “Riesenhirn” ChatGPT zu nutzen, um eine Mail an den Chef zu schreiben, ist wie mit einer Kanone auf Spatzen zu schießen.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# import spacy\n","# from collections import Counter\n","\n","preprocessed_text = preprocess_text(text2)\n","\n","# Load spaCy models\n","nlp_lg = spacy.load(\"de_core_news_lg\")\n","\n","# Function to perform NER and count entities -> we can write a function in order to spare unnecessary lines of (the same, repeated) code\n","def perform_ner_and_count(nlp, text):\n","  doc = nlp(text)\n","  ner_counts = Counter([ent.label_ for ent in doc.ents])\n","  return ner_counts\n","\n","# Perform NER with lg model\n","ner_counts_lg = perform_ner_and_count(nlp_lg, text2)\n","\n","print(\"\\nNER counts with de_dep_news_lg:\")\n","for label, count in ner_counts_lg.items():\n","  print(f\"{label}: {count}\")\n","\n","\n","# Print all NER found in the text\n","print(\"\\nNamed Entities found in the text:\")\n","doc = nlp_lg(text2)  # Analyze text2 to extract entities\n","for ent in doc.ents:\n","    print(f\"{ent.text} ({ent.label_})\")"],"metadata":{"id":"AeDyii4SeT3-","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"collapsed":true,"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730803746768,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":6171,"user":{"displayName":"Martina Kamodyová","userId":"12069066525446932918"}},"outputId":"a070809d-6a31-4474-f902-89bd90877fbc"},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","NER counts with de_dep_news_lg:\n","MISC: 31\n","LOC: 18\n","ORG: 21\n","PER: 13\n","\n","Named Entities found in the text:\n","ChatGPT (MISC)\n","Co (MISC)\n","Österreich (LOC)\n","KI-Hype (LOC)\n","KI-Modelle (MISC)\n","Microsoft (ORG)\n","Google (ORG)\n","Gemini (MISC)\n","Microsoft-Suchmaschine Bing (MISC)\n","KI (ORG)\n","ChatGPT (MISC)\n","KI-Hype\n","\n"," (LOC)\n","KI-Hype (LOC)\n","KI-Modelle (MISC)\n","KI (ORG)\n","ChatGPT (MISC)\n","Internets (MISC)\n","KI-generiertem Trash-Content (MISC)\n","KI\n","\n"," (MISC)\n","KI (ORG)\n","ChatGPT (MISC)\n","Gemini (MISC)\n","OpenAI (ORG)\n","Google (MISC)\n","Microsoft (ORG)\n","Goldman Sachs (ORG)\n","KI-Modell (ORG)\n","Google (MISC)\n","Googles (MISC)\n","PDF (MISC)\n","Kalifornien (LOC)\n","Arizona (LOC)\n","den USA (LOC)\n","amerikanischen Wüste (LOC)\n","KI-Rechenzentren (ORG)\n","Vereinigte Königreich von Großbritannien (LOC)\n","Ivan Dukic (PER)\n","KI-Startups (ORG)\n","KI-Modelle (MISC)\n","Alpen (LOC)\n","Innsbruck (LOC)\n","Innsbrucker (LOC)\n","Ivan Dukic (PER)\n","Rechenzentrums (LOC)\n","Ralph Hintemann (PER)\n","Borderstep Institut zu Digitalisierung und Nachhaltigkeit (ORG)\n","KI-Modell (ORG)\n","Meta-Modellen (PER)\n","Gemini (MISC)\n","ChatGPT (MISC)\n","ChatGPT (MISC)\n","Dukic (PER)\n","ChatGPT (MISC)\n","Shakespeare (PER)\n","Chatbot (MISC)\n","Info-Haufen (LOC)\n","US-amerikanischen (MISC)\n","Multi-Purpose-Modelle (MISC)\n","KI-Hypes (ORG)\n","KI-Modelle (MISC)\n","KI (ORG)\n","Irene Schicker (PER)\n","Geosphere Austria (ORG)\n","Schicker (PER)\n","Atmol4REN-4Cast (LOC)\n","Wettermodellen (LOC)\n","Digitalisierungsforscher (ORG)\n","Ralph Hintemann (PER)\n","Internationale Energieagentur (ORG)\n","Österreich (LOC)\n","Hintemann (PER)\n","KI (ORG)\n","Konsum (ORG)\n","Hintemann (PER)\n","Amazon (MISC)\n","TikTok (MISC)\n","Techkonzerne (PER)\n","Weiterscrollen (LOC)\n","Hintemanns (PER)\n","KI (ORG)\n","KI (MISC)\n","Riesenhirn (MISC)\n","ChatGPT (MISC)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# You can also visualize the detected named entities\n","from spacy import displacy\n","displacy.render(doc, style=\"ent\", jupyter=True)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"collapsed":true,"id":"L9HPr0G3uT_D","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730800078286,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":556,"user":{"displayName":"Martina Kamodyová","userId":"12069066525446932918"}},"outputId":"22f343f6-1e6e-4240-ce64-eed3aa868a46"},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["<span class=\"tex2jax_ignore\"><div class=\"entities\" style=\"line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr\">\n","<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n","    ChatGPT\n","    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">MISC</span>\n","</mark>\n"," und \n","<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n","    Co\n","    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">MISC</span>\n","</mark>\n"," stehen in der Kritik.

My colleagues started a discussion about the performance of NER with spaCy in German before I have finished the task. I can confirm now their concerns about a rather bad data processing. When using the mentioned pipeline, the model identifies entity types of MISC (\"Miscellaneous\"), LOC (\"Location\"), PER (\"Person\"), and ORG (\"Organization\") of the entities of the given text. I used also a visualization code of the detected named entities to see the results of the NER. The model correctly identified PER which represents names of the individual people. The entities of location (LOC) were also identified almost correctly, although there were some misidentified entities which should not have been identified as locations. I see the major problem with ORG and MISC where more errors have been made. Quite a few of the entities from the text represent products or services which have been labeled as MISC. I think a separate entity type label for products and services could help to solve the problem of broad labeling with the label \"MISC\" and serve a better named entity recognition. There is also lack of consistent labeling (f.e. \"KI\" labeled as ORG and than later as MISC)."],"metadata":{"id":"BURacTomelzy"}}]}
